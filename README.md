# Script-Loader

### What does it do?
Detect if there's a script made for the specific game and executes the main script. I was eventually going to add more games. I am not updating this script because I have been busy working on other things. The scripts in this project won't be updated for a while, so be careful when using it. I do not know if they are patched or not.

### Exploits Support

Exploit | Support Script
------------ | -------------
Fluxus | True
Synapse X | True
Sentinel | True
Protosmasher | True
Sirhurt | True

Mainly used exploits, if other exploit works with this script contact me

### How to use

* Copy the script source code from main.lua and paste it in your executor.
* Open a game that is supported for this script.
* Execute the script.
* Profits !!!
